# Ultrasensitive_Switch
Julia codes for simulating timeseries of mRNA based on transcriptional switch models. See Jeong and Kim, A robust ultrasensitive transcriptional switch in cellular environments, NPJ (2024) for details.

## Code Description
1. The cooperative binding based-switch.jl
> This code simulates the transcriptional switch regulated by cooperative binding with three binding sites using the Gillespie algorithm.

2. The sequestration based-switch.jl
> This code simulates the transcriptional switch regulated by the sole sequestration using the Gillespie algorithm.

3. The sequestration and blocking-based switch.jl
> This code simulates the transcriptional switch regulated by the sequestration and blocking using the Gillespie algorithm.

4. The sequestration blocking and displacement-based switch.jl
> This code simulates the transcriptional switch regulated by the sequestration, blocking, and displacement using the Gillespie algorithm.
